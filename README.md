# SRXD-FC-or-Restart
Overly complicated Python script to replace a mod that used to exist

## Quick Start Instructions:
Download the .zip file [from here](https://github.com/kylefmohr/SRXD-FC-or-Restart/releases), make sure `settings.ini` matches your in-game settings, then run main.exe to start the mod!

## "I'm not scared of Python dependencies" Instructions:
 - You may want to create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .`, then activate the virtual environment: `.\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

 - Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

 - Take a peek at `settings.ini` and change anything that needs to be changed

 - Run the script: `python3 main.py`
